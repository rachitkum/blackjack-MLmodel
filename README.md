## Features
- **Interactive Blackjack Game**: Play Blackjack in the browser using JavaScript.
- **ML-Powered Move Suggestions**: The ML model suggests the optimal move (`Hit`, `Stand`, `Split`, `Double Down`) for the player based on the current game state.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Get move suggestions in real time as the game progresses.

## Demo
will be updated

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash

   cd blackjack-ml
2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages from requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. ***Run the Backend Server***
   Start the Python server that serves the ML model:
   ```bash
   python server.py

## Usuage
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Begin playing the Blackjack game.
3. Observe the ML model's suggested moves, which appear as recommendations with each hand you are dealt.

## Model Details
The ML model was trained using a dataset of Blackjack games to predict the best move based on the player's and dealer's cards. 
The model uses various Blackjack strategies to guide its suggestions, which are integrated with JavaScript to provide real-time feedback.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Machine Learning Model**: Python (using libraries  ---)
- **Backend**: Python (Django)
